Find and hire the best staff for each respective step of the process and equip them with the right tools to optimize your business. Design your shop for the best throughput, and seek out new opportunities in the market as customers come in looking for a variety of historically inspired items – from weapons and armor to tools and cooking utensils, you’ll perfect your craft to become the Blacksmith Master. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/blacksmithGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_01.png"><br><br>\nTucked away through the winding alleys of a small medieval town lies your workshop – at first just a humble place for a humble blacksmith, but with potential for greatness. Here, you control the entire production chain - from mining the ores to smelting them into ingots, then crafting weapons, armor, tools, and jewelry to put on display and sell to customers for a profit. You will design your shop to make the best use of space, ensuring there’s enough room for the production and sale of goods alike, while adding personal touches to liven up an otherwise dreary space. As your reputation grows, so too will your operation, and it won’t be long before you become a master of your craft. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/minersGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_02.png"><br><br>\nBe it a footman’s sword, a woodsman’s axe, or an inn keeper’s frying pan, everything you produce will require raw materials dug up from the earth. Hire miners, equip them with the right tools, and ensure they have everything they need to be efficient – without them, you cannot keep your business operational. Each additional miner means additional wages that need to be paid, though overworked staff are likely to get tired and inefficient. Will you opt to provide rest stations and additional staff to keep your employees satisfied regardless of cost, or will you instead keep a handful of overworked individuals to maximize your profits? After all, mining the ore is only the first step of the process, and there are many more wages to pay. \n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/smelterGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_03.png"><br><br>\nThere will be many different ways to craft items in Blacksmith Master - some will require a longer process which includes heating an ingot, hammering it on an anvil, tempering it, assembling parts, and finally sharpening it on a grinding wheel.  Other items will be simpler to make, requiring less effort and time, though they might sell for a smaller profit margin as a result. \n<br>\nYour job will be to optimize your workspace as much as possible so your team of blacksmiths can work in tandem, creating goods from the simple to the highly complex, servicing customers from and around your small town. Besides weapons, shields, and armor, your crafting recipes will include other common things that medieval blacksmiths would make. This includes items like:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Kitchen utensils - spoons, forks, pots, cauldrons and everything in between.\n<br></li><li>Tools - from axes to hammers, take your pick!\n<br></li><li>Jewelry - necklaces, rings, bracelets, and crowns all fetch a handsome price.\n<br></li><li>Plus many others!</li></ul><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/mp4/grindingStoneGif.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/blacksmith_master/headline_04.png"><br><br>\nDifferent blacksmiths will have different skills that you need to cultivate. Some will be great at working with metal, others will be great glassblowers, and others still might be particularly proficient with gems. Crafting items of a certain category will increase a blacksmith’s skill level, enabling them to craft more complex creations, though it might come with an added cost. Will you train them as generalists, ensuring they all have support when needed, or will you seek to train famed specialists?\n\n\n            \n    	495.59	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:09.688-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:11:10.06-03	2023-09-14 17:11:58.356-03	92

Set yourself up for the finishing strike and possibly roll a natural 20 at that key moment of battle.​\n<br><br><br>\nIn Solasta, you take control of four heroes, each with unique skills that complement one another. Every hero expresses themselves in the adventure, making each action and dialog choice a dynamic part to the story. Players will create their heroes just as they would in a pen-and-paper game by choosing their race, class, personality and rolling for their stats.​\n<br><br>\nYou make the choices, dice decide your destiny.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/solasta_crown_of_the_magister/mp4/TeamGifv3.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>An Epic Team Adventure</b><br>\nDiscover the shattered world of Solasta: explore ruins and dungeons for legendary treasures, learn the truth of an age-old cataclysm - and stop it from happening again. \n<br><br>\nCreate your very own party of adventurers with our Character Creation Tool in the classic tabletop RPG tradition. Breathe life into your heroes, and see their personalities reflected in their dialogue. Tailor your squad to your preferred strategy and maximize your party's abilities. The choice is yours.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Discover a Mysterious &amp; Dynamic World</b><br>\nDelve into long forgotten dungeons to unearth ancient artifacts, but stay watchful of light and darkness: many dangers hide in the dark, but a light can attract monsters. Some enemies have darkvision, some may flee from your torch... Successful adventurers will learn to use it to their advantage. \n<br><br>\nFight monsters in squad-level, turn-based, tactical combat. Solasta's dynamic environment offers some interesting tactical options. Bridges can collapse, leaving enemies stranded and vulnerable. Walls and columns can be pushed over - on top of your foes, if you do it right. The world is your playground.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Prepare to Think in Three Dimensions</b><br>\nThe dungeons in Solasta are more than flat game-boards. Climb, jump, or fly around obstacles. Evade or surprise foes from above or below. Push them into chasms or drop things on their heads. Position yourself on high grounds to start the fight with an advantage. \n<br><br>\nSize also matters. Escape through narrow passages where bigger enemies won't fit and crawl through tunnels to find secret areas. Take advantage of the environment to find cover suited to your own size. Watch out, though - the monsters are also thinking vertically.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Dungeon Maker</b><br>\nIn Solasta, the adventure does not stop after the campaign is over. Unleash your creativity and craft your own dungeons to play and share with friends with the snap of a finger using the in-game Dungeon Maker! From the room layout, monster composition and treasure the party will find – down to the decoration and lighting of each room or the music track playing – everything is decided by you.\n<br><br>\nNote that the Dungeon Maker is a work in progress and will keep being improved as time goes by, so look forward to more Dungeon Maker features in the future!</li></ul><h4>Solasta Free Content Update with the release of Primal Calling</h4><b>To celebrate the release of the Primal Calling DLC, we're releasing a free content update for all our players</b> - including a much anticipated higher level cap!\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Level cap increased from level 10 to level 12, unlocking new class features as well as level 6 spells\n<br></li><li>Scars and Facial Paints customization options in character creation\n<br></li><li>Tired of playing through the tutorial? You can now skip it!\n<br></li><li>Rebalanced (harder!) fight at the end of the campaign - prepare for a challenge!\n<br></li><li>New Town Exterior &amp; Town Interior Environments for the Dungeon Maker\n<br></li><li>New Campaign Creator Feature, allowing custom dungeons to be bundled together into a campaign with custom monsters, custom NPCs &amp; merchants and custom items!</li></ul><br><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2020 Tactical Adventures.

The famed Slovakian highlander and robber Janosik just finished a quest to rescue his comrades and is now on the path to defeat even more enemies – both mythical and historical. This time around, it’s not the band of brothers that’s missing, but rather Janosik himself. Caught with an ingenious ruse, our hero must rescue himself, his beloved and make new friends on the way.\n<br><h4>STORY</h4>\nAccompany Highlander Janosik, Bogdan the Werewolf and a cloak-wrapped Vampire as they explore the dark and trap-filled castle von Zur, house to the nefarious kidnapper Baron. Trek through dense mountain forests that are home to feral dogs, headless skeletons and more, all bent on making your life harder. Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	495.59	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:37.516-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:12:00.836-03	2023-09-14 17:12:03.158-03	96

TriOptimum Corporation	<i>TriOptimum wishes you a safe journey aboard the Von Braun, the first craft in the history of mankind capable of faster-than-light travel. TriOptimum Corporation: we give you the stars!</i><br><br>\nThe second--and best!--game in the series stands all on its own as a masterpiece of gaming history. The starship Von Braun took a giant leap for mankind as it made its first interstellar journey. The mission was going as planned until a lone distress call from the Tau Ceti V sector was picked up. An away team was sent on a rescue mission, but once it arrived at its destination, there was no sign of any humans and the source of the signal remained unclear. They didn't realize something crucial, though: they brought something back with them when they returned. Now, you--a member of the ship's security team--awake from cryostasis to the sounds of screams of pain and horror as everything falls apart. The state-of-the-art spaceship becomes a deathtrap, and the only hope you have is the contemptuous whisper of a voice guiding you through the dark corridors, leading you towards the ominous secrets that lurk in the shadows.\n<br><br>\nA game like this is a masterpiece; you must experience it firsthand. System Shock™ 2 arguably offers the most intense storytelling in the history of computer games. It perfectly splices Sci-Fi with survival horror, FPS gameplay with character stats, upgrades, and inventory system of the role-playing genre, fast paced action with chilling terror. As you slowly and carefully explore your surroundings, the game begins to swallow you whole, and soon enough you feel completely immersed in the terrifying reality of an interstellar ghost-ship. Then, even years after your first contact with the game, just hearing the words "System Shock™ 2" will make your heart race. This is going to be a hell of a journey, for a pathetic creature of meat and bone such as yourself.\n<br><br>\nCheck out our <b><a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/mod_spotlight_system_shock_2">Mod Spotlight for System Shock 2!</a></b><br><br>\n-<i>"10 out of 10"</i> - Computer Games Magazine<br>\n-<i>"An advanced, progressive spin on first-person gaming"</i> - Edge Online<br>\n-<i>"One of the 100 best games of all time"</i> - Empire Online<br>\n-<i>"95%"</i> - PC Gamer<br>\n-<i>"Greatest Games of all Times"</i> list - Gamespot<br>\n-<i>"Top 50 Greatest Games of All Time"</i> list - Gamespy<br><br><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">The most requested game on the <a href="http://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/system_shock_2" class="vdark_un">GOG.com wishlist</a> has arrived at last!</li><li class="description__features-point">Three character profiles to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses: the psionic power-wielding agent, the naval officer--a masterful hacker, and the marine, a combat specialist.</li><li class="description__features-point">You don't have to face the horror alone.

I discovered this game by chance as a kid - I was wondering what to play next (and I’ve just begun my lifelong adventure with PC gaming) and this game was added to my newly bought graphics card. I installed it and after the first minutes in Seyda Neen I knew that it was it - unique setting, weird monsters and the freedom to just walk around Vvardenfell, visit different cities, read (a lot of) books and do quests for different factions. \n\nI go back to this game quite often (apreciating the music in the game even more) and go on an adventure with a newly created character.

Despite that, in response to Diablo players who have expressed a desire to experience the content, Blizzard has given the OK for it to be included as a free add-on with Diablo purchases on GOG.COM.\n<br><br>\nHellfire offers a non-canonical single-player storyline where players must defeat a powerful demon named Na-Krul who is threatening Tristram. The expansion also adds a Monk class, new weapons and items, new missions, locations, dungeons, and enemies. Hellfire will be accessible while launching the original Diablo.</p><br><hr><br><i>Traveler, stay awhile and listen...</i><br><br>\n\nDarkness stirs beneath Tristram.\nAn ancient evil sweeps across the land, plunging it into civil war and terrorizing the populace. A mad king, his missing son, and a mysterious archbishop are all pieces of the puzzle you need to hack through.\nYou have journeyed to the source of this evil. The town of Tristram - now inhabited only by a handful of survivors, broken and twisted by the madness that has befallen them. A cathedral stands there, built over the ruins of an ancient monastery. Eerie lights and ungodly sounds are heard echoing through its abandoned halls, and that is where you shall venture.<br><br><i>Embark, if you dare, on a quest to destroy The Prime Evil…</i><br><br><ul><li>Experience the legendary action/RPG that influenced an entire genre.</li><li>Storm Diablo's halls as either a Warrior, a Sorcerer or a Rogue - each with unique skills and abilities.</li><li>Unite to destroy Diablo - up to 4 players can band together via Internet, or play head-to-head via LAN.</li><li>Unprecedented replayability - over 200 different monsters inhabit Diablo's ever-changing labyrinth.

You play as half-metal, half-human, half-crazy Johnny Turbo, augmented with hidden arm rockets and a chainsaw that extends from your lower leg allowing you to kick-slice enemies wide open.\n<br><br>\nIn this <i>Blade Runner</i>-meets-<i>DOOM </i>hellscape, Johnny returns to his hometown of Paradise and finds its entire population possessed by Syn, a rogue AI, and its army of augmented minions. Desperate for enough money to outrun his past mistakes, Johnny takes on the impossible job of destroying the greatest AI ever created. Rival bounty hunters want to claim the prize first. Nothing is easy in paradise.\n<br><b><h4>Hero Time, wall-running, dashing and grappling hooks, oh my</h4></b><i>Turbo Overkill</i> takes over-the-top to never-before-reached heights. Activate Hero Time(™), a new form of slow motion with a twist. Build incredible speed by wall-running and dashing. Slide on your chainsaw leg, eviscerating foes and opening up bosses for critical damage, and go car-surfing on the hoods of flying cars. Blast away with the Twin Magnums, which lock-on and instagib several foes, the Boomer Shotgun and its attached grenade launcher, or the Telefragger sniper rifle, which teleports Johnny inside an enemy before they explode from within. The FPS genre is about to get wild and fun again.\n<br><br>\nRace through two dozen stages packed with secrets, bonus arena stages, and white-knuckle combat puzzles. Find game-changing collectibles to unlock punishing modifiers like triple-monster-speed and insta-kill. Combine all of Johnny’s weapons and powers to outsmart, outgun and outrun the corrupted legions.\n<br><b><h4>TL;DR:</h4></b>o Kill a boss, get its augment (special power)\n<br>\no Play Spider-Man with your grappling hook\n<br>\no One-up Duke Nukem with your chainsaw kick\n<br>\no Kills = cash. Use cash to install augments, upgrade your weapons, and add new abilities in your talent tree\n<br>\no Be a ghost runner while wall running\n<br>\no Attack from above riding the hood of your flying car like a kung-furious badass\n<br>\no Mini-rockets built into your robotic arm? ✔\n<br>\no This. List. Will. Grow. Wishlist the game to see it happen\n<br><b><h4>Don't quote us on nuthin'</h4></b>“<i>Turbo Overkill</i> is fast, frenetic and ferocious—excess personified,” said Sam Prebble, one half of Trigger Happy Interactive. “This is the game we’ve always wanted to play; making it is a dream project. Relentless enemies, extremely deadly and fun weapons, speed and precision above all else—if you love <i>Quake III Arena</i>, modern and classic <i>DOOM</i>, or Apogee’s legendary first-person shooters, you’ll feel right at home in Paradise.”\n<br><br>\n“As the guy who helped launch the shooter genre with <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i>, <i>Rise of the Triad, Duke Nukem 3D, Max Payne</i>, and <i>Prey</i>, I haven’t been this excited about an FPS since the golden era of Apogee/3D Realms,” wrote Scott Miller, founder. “<i>Turbo Overkill</i> is a sandbox of fun and original gameplay ideas that come together like a night of melty hot pizza and your favorite cold, frothy brew. Playing this game made me a Turbo Lover all over again.”\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright (c) 2020 Trigger Happy Interactive.

Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\n<br>\n\nOr perhaps an explorer?

Boxed in a by a quarrelsome king, duplicitous advisors, and enemies on all sides, there is no recourse to resolve this peacefully. It seems that Diplomacy Is Not an Option!\n<br>\nExperience warfare on an entirely new scale as over 10 THOUSAND enemy units assault your castle walls. Do you have what it takes to save the kingdom? Is the kingdom even worth saving?<h4>The Law Of War</h4>Your King is a mighty, and bold leader. The only thing he loves more than drinking is fighting, and he’s done a lot of it. Whilst waging foreign wars and conquests, the lands at home have been neglected; infrastructure is decaying, and the people are slowly starving. The ground is fertile for the seeds of rebellion! \n<br>\nMisled by feckless advisors the King cares not for the bureaucracy of statecraft, so when the masses rise up there is little warning or aide to be found. You alone must don the helm of battle and defend your lands from the murderous peasants. But victory will grant you scarce relief as you are the only one proven capable of protecting the kingdom. You must put down the rebellions, flush out its leaders, and restore stability. \n<br>\nRumours abound of vast treasures in distant lands, exactly what the King needs to feed the people and fund more beer and war. Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers? Surely the native peoples will offer no resistance to your pilfering. What could go wrong?<h4>The Physical Laws</h4>Diplomacy Is Not an Option takes the laws of physics very seriously: there are no hit-scan crossbows to be found here! Your archers and siege engines will need clear trajectories to hit their targets, so good placement of your towers and defences is vital. \n<br>\nThousands of enemy soldiers will advance on your walls and archers positioned behind them must fire up and over; dramatically reducing their range and accuracy. Providing your units with elevated firing positions will greatly increase their effectiveness. Likewise, a ballista or catapult-thrown boulder will do no good if they crash into a cliff mid-flight.\n<br>\nConsider your gates, your lines of advancement and retreat. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions. You will need to take an active role in combat to get the best from your men.<h4>The Laws of a Functional Society</h4>The world of Diplomacy Is Not an Option is not a kind one. Food can become scarce, and your soldiers can starve on the battlefield. Homes must be protected, diseases managed, and corpses hauled away and buried with respect.\n<br>\nIf you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with a most unpleasant plague, or with battlements guarded only by the wasting bones of your malnourished soldiers.<h4>Economic Laws</h4>A functional army requires a functional economy to support and feed it. Food, Wood, Stone, Iron, and Gold are the foundations of your city’s economy, and you will need to watch your supplies carefully if you are to meet the advancing foe in a timely manner. Gather resources, choose your storage locations, plan your expansions and upgrades with care. The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will fall prey to hostile incursion. \n<br>\nTrade, via the impressive merchant dirigible, offers a lifeline to besieged cities, bringing emergency supplies of food to feed the men, or stone to rebuild the walls. It might help just enough to tip the scales. Can you strike the balance between greedy expansion and security? Between builders and farmers and fighters?<h4>The Laws of Magic</h4>Fickle and treacherous, most shun the use of magic in the lands. Those who dare tamper with the occult are viewed with suspicion and fear, and with good reason. There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs the dead and traps wayward souls. A proper burial for your slain is not just a tradition, it is a necessity. \n<br>\nOn the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies. So enjoy that too.<h4>The Fundamental Laws of Life</h4>The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. The Endless Mode grants you full access to the tech tree and there are no limitations on how you approach the challenges that the procedurally generated maps provide. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you.\n<br>\nThe campaign will offer you challenges of combat and morality: it is a grim and unpleasant world. Few are worthy of your allegiance and even fewer will trust it. As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully. At this stage: Diplomacy Is Not an Option!\n\n\n            \n    	47.49	2022-02-08	BR0	2022-09-24 01:37:10.264-03	\N	\N	2022-09-24 01:37:43.788-03	2022-09-24 01:37:44.009-03	38

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	495.59	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:40.123-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:12:00.899-03	2023-09-14 17:12:03.065-03	96

Each and every descent will lead to new adventures, where	<img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/quotes.png"><br><br>\nBelow the Stone is a punishing pixel art roguelike about dwarves questing to reach the deepest depths. Each and every descent will lead to new adventures, where only the most determined players with many risked lives will be rewarded by the hidden world that lies Below the Stone.<h4><b>Explore a Deep World of Ancient Mysteries</b></h4>Discover the lore of dwarves, the treasures they die for, and the secrets they rarely speak of. Within the stone below lies the adventure everyone seeks, but there's always a price. Often death.<h4><b>Mine and Magically Merge Gems</b></h4>Mine rare gems that grant magical buffs and can be socketed to your weapons and armor. When you have enough of one type of gem merge them together to make a more powerful version! This can be done over and over.<h4><b>The World Below is Not Safe</b></h4>Each level deeper pits you against more cunning creatures and more dangerous biomes. But also greater rewards to mine and uncover. No pain no gain. (And some pain can be relieved with a pint of Dwarven brew.)<h4><b>Roguelike Gameplay</b></h4> With each descent, you'll explore and find many unique ores, gems, and ancient treasures that have been buried before time -- all which will help you delve deeper in future descents...but only if you craft the right gear to survive.<h4><b>Enough Variety Fit for a Dwarven Dinner Feast</b></h4>With over 25 uniquely dangerous and graphically beautiful biomes, there's no lack of new environments and resources to find -- but tread carefully, as each has its own distinct threats as well.<h4><b>Crafting Equipment</b></h4>Prepare each dive below the stone by crafting new equipment, socketing new gems, and brewing new potions with all the resources you've harvested from your previous journeys ... But beware, when you die, anything lost below the stone ... will remain forever buried below the stone.\n<br><br>\nDwarves will be sent below the surface to collect metal and precious gems that your kin request of you. However, you can keep any extra you gain-- make a new pickaxe, a sword, some armor. Whatever increases your odds of coming back on your next trip! Store them safely at the dwarven kingdom, your hub area for crafting, storying items safely for your next expedition, and picking up new missions from your kin. But we warned! If you die Below the Stone, everything you carried on you will be lost under the surface forever.\n<br><br>\nWith each descent you can also decide whether or not you are prepared to go deeper in your journey. Each layer's entrance will be held within a dungeon as a final challenge to see if you are capable and prepared enough to descend further. Once you go down, you will face a bevy of new biomes, creatures, resources, and environments to explore. Each layer is will contain 8-12 unique biomes that will challenge a dwarf's resourcefulness and grit.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/biome.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/biomes_examples.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/kingdom.png"><br><br>\nThe Dwarven kingdom is your place for crafting, preparation, and most importantly storing loot for later expeditions. You have full control over what items you bring with you, what equipment you craft, and what items you choose to keep at home safe and sound. The only catch is if you die, you will lose all the items you took down into the caves on your dwarf - such is the cost of progress!  Additionally, your stay in the dwarven kingdom will yield an ever-growing cast of allies to aid you on your adventures below the surface. For example...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting4.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting1.png"><br>\nA dwarf's best friend is someone who can turn shiny things into useful tools. The Blacksmith is the reliable friend you can return home to when you're in need of proper weaponry, armor, and equipment for your future descents.  His skills will aid in crafting your newly found ores into fresh new equipment to help you on your next trip into the depths, arming yourself for the dangerous realms below...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting5.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting2.png"><br>\nSome characters may be encountered underground and are in need of rescue; these folk will be welcomed to the dwarven kingdom as new companions to help you on your future journeys. You may bump into anything at all, from elven witches who brew potions to legendary dragon-slayers -  and even necromancers! We plan on the kingdom having at least 10 - 12 important mainline characters you will be able to save and bring back to help your future adventures. Each of them will add a unique flavor to the kingdom and your journeys downward as they give you better chances, modifiers, and even change your playstyle.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting6.png"><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/crafting3.png"><br>\nKeeping goblins from scalping that freshly trimmed beard of yours is a top priority for a dwarf - not to mention a mark on their honor to keep their hair intact - so make sure to do anything you can to increase your odds of coming back on your next trip! Brand new armor, weapons, and tools do make your missions easier, but be warned: if you die in Below The Stone, everything remains buried Below The Stone. Forever. So calculate your risks and use your resources wisely, starting with the banker - your trusted ally to make sure your items are safe when you decide not to bring certain equipment! This will let smart and experienced players plan out their future runs well ahead of time, and let you decide if this is the moment you decide to risk it all on and go deeper than you've ever gone before in the name of dwarven progress...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/below_the_stone/features_image.png"><br><br><b>Features:</b><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Procedurally generated cave complexes which lead to a new adventure in every descent. \n<br></li><li>Plans on releasing 50+ biomes to explore with unique creatures, fauna, and resources to explore.\n<br></li><li>5 planned layers to explore.\n<br></li><li>Multiple dungeons on each layer to test your mettle.\n<br></li><li>Full character customization (Your equipment determines your stats and abilities).\n<br></li><li>A Dwarven Kingdom with many important characters to meet, save, and aid!\n<br></li><li>Custom Cave missions for every descent.\n<br></li><li>Roguelike experience (If you die, you lose everything you brought with you!)\n<br></li><li>Tough, but Fair!

The development team at LucasArts is bringing the game into the modern era with an all new re-imagined contemporary art style, a re-mastered musical score, full voiceover, and an in-depth hint system to help players through the game’s side-splitting puzzles. Purists will also delight in the ability to seamlessly switch between the updated hand-drawn re-imagining and the original classic version.\n<br><br>\nThe game's twisty plot leads our naive hero on a hilarious, swash-buckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island. Tales of pirate wealth lure him to the port of Mêlée with high hopes, no money, and insatiable curiosity. If clever enough, he will win the confidence of Mêlée's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Go on a daring adventure in your attempt to become the most infamous pirate in the Caribbean!</li><li class="description__features-point">Scene-for-scene hot swap allows for seamless transition between special edition and classic modes anywhere and at any time.</li><li class="description__features-point">Complete voice over using the original Monkey Island™ franchise cast brings the story and characters of the original adventures to life like never before.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            LucasArts and the LucasArts logo are trademarks of Lucasfilm Ltd. in the United States and/or other countries. © 1990-2014 Lucasfilm Ltd.

Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system.\n<br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/falling_frontier/mp4/Banner.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>A New Star System</h4>Explore a vast procedurally generated star system filled with planets, moons, asteroid fields, and nebulae.

Building a city on the back of a sentient creature comes with its own set of challenges, but as you build your relationship and travel across the galaxy, you'll come across great opportunities for exploration and stable expansion. Meet other species, pursue the needs and wants of your Peeps, and seek the truth about their ancestors, and the Space Whales alike.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_01.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_01.png"><br><br>\nThe Peeps have managed to establish a fledgling settlement on Kewa's back. Now you must grow your civilisation and relationship with Kewa if you are to survive the challenges of the greater universe, navigating the limited space and resources available on Kewa as best as possible. Will you establish massive industries at the expense of your relationship with Kewa, or use Kewa primarily as a home, gathering resources at your settlements when possible instead? Watch out for pollution that upsets Peeps and Kewa alike, and consider approaching city-building in a sustainable way to maintain the happiness of the Peeps without destroying their future. Learn to harness the benefits of each season as Kewa travels closer to and further away from suns, but be wary of seasonal dangers to your survival, and the vagaries of Kewa's desires.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_02.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_02.png"><br><br>\nKewa is an intelligent and ancient being, traveling as they please across the randomly generated universe. The Peeps must first build a relationship with Kewa if they wish to influence their travels. Will your decisions be at the cost of Kewa's happiness, ensuring the Peeps are taken care of above all, or will you care for Kewa as well, limiting your exploitation, and potentially upsetting the Peeps as their demands aren't met as often? As the bond grows, you will journey across the galaxy and establish small settlements on planets to access new resources, coordinating the movement of goods from them to Kewa and back. Deciding where to go and who to engage with will determine how the Peeps progress - will you prioritise industrialisation, cultural prosperity, or both hand-in-hand? Besides planets and asteroids, alien races will have mysteries of their own, presenting new opportunities and advancements to your Peeps.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_03.png"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/headline_03.png"><br><br>\nThough Beyond These Stars is primarily a city-builder, asking you to manage the puzzle of limited space, having you juggle access to one resource at the cost of another, or giving you advantages when using specific layouts, your settlements aren't the only things you'll be building. The relationship between the Peeps and Kewa is a crucial aspect of your survivability, and to that end, you'll be concerned with keeping Kewa happy while keeping the Peeps alive. Your approach to sustainability and pollution will further influence how others feel about your Peeps - they all have something to offer, but only to those they like. From additional objectives and their subsequent rewards to new technologies and the doors they open, your progress is determined by the way you treat the world around you. Will you focus on being self-sufficient at the cost of sustainability, or will you prioritise these relationships with others at the cost of your civilisations efficiency and happiness? Success in Beyond These Stars is not simply a matter of exploitation and organisation, but instead, it is a matter of the relationships you nurture, and the symbiotic relationship between your Peeps and the universe around them.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/beyond_these_stars/image_04.png">	495.59	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:26.846-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:11:59.474-03	2023-09-14 17:12:00.306-03	92

Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. \n<br><br>\nEach mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all here.<p></p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then, in 2018, with the developer’s original 486 PC back in action, the author, Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.\n<br><br>\nAs this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind. Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment. Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's systems and much more. \n<br><br>\nWhile the game might look daunting at first, there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions and more. \n<br><br>\nAlso please note that there is no mouse control in this game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.  \n<br><br>\nThis is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s. Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank you!</p><br><b><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></b> is the second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations. Having fought as an Alliance starship commander in Star Fleet I to stem the onslaught of the Krellan and Zaldron Empires, now you get a chance to try command on the "winning" side.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_015.png"><br><i>A Pitched Battle with an Enemy Starbase</i><br><br>\nAs Commander of a Krellan Battlecruiser with four destroyer escorts (forming a "battle fleet"), your mission is to explore the star systems of the United Galactic Alliance looking for planets to conquer and Alliance warships to destroy.

Also at your command are elite shock troops for boarding and capturing enemy vessels, and legions of Krellan warriors for planetary invasions.\n<br><br><b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> gives you more depth, complexity, and realism than any space war simulation before or since.

Every time you invade a planet, <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> switches to a complete planetary invasion game that allows you to control the conquering Krellan forces in their attempt to overwhelm the planetary defenders.\n<br><br>\nFrom up to dozens of military targets on the detailed planetary map, select and control up to eight invasion zones from your Invasion Control Screen, or take personal command of your units. Your objectives: to capture cities and factories; knock out shield generators, planetary defense phasers, point defense lasers, and missile launchers; and eliminate both UGA troops and native militia forces. Like combat in space, planetary combat is real-time (no turns, but you can pause!).\n<br><br>\nExplore uncharted star systems and planets - your landing parties may even discover the ruins of ancient civilizations that may contain beneficial alien artifacts. Attack and pillage planets, wipe out civilizations with a single command, interrogate prisoners from a captured starliner, then beam those prisoners into the sun or empty space to improve your crew's morale! Who says command can't be fun?!\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/bp_000_640.png"><br><i>Capturing an Enemy Frigate</i><br><br>\nFeatures of <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> 1.0:\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>35 galactic regions with over 1,700 star systems and 1,000 unique planets to explore and conquer\n<br></li><li>Each planet has its own unique surface, which you can view from orbit\n<br></li><li>Over 10 different types of starships, including: Alliance heavy and light cruisers, destroyers, frigates, scouts, freighters and starliners; Krellan battlecruisers, destroyers, troopships and supply ships\n<br></li><li>Realtime simulation of movement and combat, both space and planetary\n<br></li><li>Ship-to-ship and fleet combat\n<br></li><li>12 critical ship's systems simulated\n<br></li><li>New commands include; communications, intelligence, strategic command, logistics, obliterator pods, science, medical, planetary invasions and more\n<br></li><li>Landing parties to explore planets, contact planetary civilizations, establish bases, obtain supplies and more\n<br></li><li>Legions of elite Krellan warriors for conquering planets, with battle honors persistent through new regions\n<br></li><li>Simulation of crew fatigue and morale, supplies and interactions with captives\n<br></li><li>Multiple mission objectives\n<br></li><li>Assume personal command of planetary invasions and control individual units. \n<br></li><li>Seven ranks with five missions each, each increasing in complexity\n<br></li><li>Sound/music toggle with original PC speaker sound effects</li></ul><h4>About Version 2.0</h4>\n2.0 is a severely updated and enhanced version of the original game, with a wide variety of improvements and additions to the original game!<h4>Improvements in 2.0 (list will grow and change as we approach release)</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Improved AI\n<br></li><li>Improved UI\n<br></li><li>Numerous Bug Fixes\n<br></li><li>Quality of Life Enhancements with Improved Key Commands\n<br></li><li>New Features such as Beaming Prisoners Into Stars, Ship Performance Data and More!\n<br></li><li>New Overlays such as Fleet Command, Probe Operations and More!</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_032.png"><br><i>Krellan Warriors have Landed in One of Eight Invasion Zones of a Technologically-Advanced Planet</i><br><br>\n*1.0 Documents Scanned by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.scribd.com/user/5846146/remow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remowilliams</a>	495.59	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:55.554-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:12:05.775-03	2023-09-14 17:12:06.918-03	107

ARE YOU MAD?:Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we’ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the commun	<h4>A FREE DLC!?!? ARE YOU MAD?:</h4>Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we’ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn’t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here’s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it’s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/CavernTravelling.gif"><h4>Features:</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>New levels</b>: You’ve got a new level that’s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who’s finished the game at least once. You’ve got another (poorly) hidden level, for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5\n<br></li><li><b>New Bosses</b>: Mirroring the above, you’ve got a new completely different type of boss available in the main level structure, with another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more ridiculously difficult content.\n<br></li><li><b>New content</b>: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and…\n<br></li><li><b>Skins</b>: People have been requesting this for ages and we’ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accomadate the request. You’ve now got access to female skins, fluro skins and a christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dead_cells_-_rise_of_the_giant/TravellingVerticalAstrolab.gif"><br><br>\nOn top of these major changes we’re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n<br><br>\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we’re not done, we’ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you’d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.\n\n\n            \n    	0.00	2019-03-27	BR0	2023-05-16 11:12:06.361-03	\N	\N	2023-05-16 11:13:05.634-03	2023-05-16 11:13:06.164-03	47

The quantity and caster level of available scrolls depends on how high your "Arcane" kingdom stat is.<br><br>\nFurthermore, if you like turning into giant dragons as much as we do, you'll definitely enjoy the fresh, improved models for chromatic and metallic types of these formidable creatures.<br><br>\nFinally, on a more serious note, the last part of this DLC is a new pet. One of our players and our friend, known to the community as Stratagemini, lost his beloved cat Tiger just weeks before the launch of our game. Stratagemini has been with us since the earliest days of development, supporting us every step of the way, providing extensive and enlightening feedback in the alpha, and helping to shape this community into what it is today. As a token of our eternal gratitude, we've recreated Tiger in the game so that he may roam with his human friend once more - if only in the Stolen Lands.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            Pathfinder and Kingmaker are trademarks and copyrights owned exclusively by Paizo Inc. and used under license.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father's post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr's social order and foil its mission.\n<br><br>\nBetween Horizons is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process – all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control.<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/between_horizons/mp4/between-horizons-gif-show-evidence.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><h4>Key Features of Between Horizons:</h4><ul><li><b>A New Kind Of Experience:</b> Between Horizons merges investigative-style gameplay with a branching sci-fi story in an ever-expanding Metroidvania-style environment.</li><li><b>Solving cases for yourself:</b> The flexible evidence system lets players assign clues to cases, confront ship denizens about them, and submit any case with evidence players have connected to it. Everything found on the ship is connected, but figuring out how — that’s the challenge.</li><li><b>At What Cost?:</b> Underneath the game's exciting and plausible sci-fi plot lies a number of thought-provoking problems inviting players to weigh intergenerational responsibility against personal freedom.</li><li><b>Getting New Perspective:</b> Timeless pixel art mixed with 3D environments and compelling visual effects come together in Between Horizons, creating a unique, beautiful art style.</li><li><b>Failure is Very Much an Option:</b> There are no second chances — submitting wrong solutions means the story will go on and players live with the consequences. A new and improved auto-save system will make sure there is no going back, as the story branches and endings are based on player decisions, none of which can be taken back.</li></ul><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/between_horizons/mp4/between-horizons-gif-walk.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright DigiTales Interactive GmbH 2022 - all rights reserved!\n        </p>	27.90	2023-12-30	BR0	2023-09-14 17:11:21.675-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 17:11:59.472-03	2023-09-14 17:11:59.958-03	86

The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.\n<br><br>\nThe music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!\n<br><br>\nTreasure Adventure Game was created by Stephen Orlando. He spent over 2 years of his life developing it. When you see the scope and detail in this game, it’s hard to believe that it was created by just one guy. But it was!

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\n<br><br>\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.<h4>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</h4>Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.<h4>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</h4>Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.<h4>Created by a Legendary Crew</h4>The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).\n\n\n            \n    	73.99	2022-11-27	BR0	2023-09-14 00:00:30.296-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 00:00:56.659-03	2023-09-14 00:00:57.117-03	57

Use your unparalleled mythic powers to do battle with truly invincible opponents. This additional campaign offers 7–8 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #2:</h4>\nNew additional campaign. The demon attack on Kenabres changed the lives of many. While the mythic hero and their loyal companions were busy liberating the city, the common folk had to find a way to survive, relying only on their humble skills.\nBand together with other survivors and try to reach the Defender's Heart tavern, the last foothold of the crusader forces in the city. Choose who will join your group, and make difficult decisions about allocating scarce resources. Remember — in fire-ravaged Kenabres, every scroll and potion could make the difference not only in an individual fight but also to your very survival. Act in the group's best interests or focus solely on your own well-being. Import your choices to the main campaign and look forward to seeing this story develop in other DLC. This additional campaign offers 6–7 hours of gameplay.\n\n<h4>DLC #3:</h4>\nA new rogue-like mode with partial integration into the main campaign. In Alushinyrra's port, climb aboard a cursed ship that will transport you to a mysterious whirlpool lost amidst the Midnight Isles. Dive in and discover a dungeon whose proportions you can only guess at. Go exploring in search of glory, loot, and battles, and come face to face with a secret that will benefit either Nocticula, the mistress of the archipelago, or her enemies. The dungeon's levels, created using random zone generation, are populated with various enemies, devious traps, and secret rooms. You will return victorious to Alushinyrra — or else the cursed ship will return on its own, laden with trophies from the last expedition, to await new adventure-seekers.\n\n\n\n            \n    	266.98	2021-09-01	BR0	2023-09-14 00:00:42.57-03	\N	\N	2023-09-14 00:00:59.713-03	2023-09-14 00:00:59.99-03	80

Regardless of the success or failure of their mission, the caravans must send the memories they have gained back to the capital, using the crystospheres carried by traveling beetles. <br><br><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" data-fallbackurl="https://items.gog.com/sandwalkers/Gif_Mainfeatures.gif"><source src="https://items.gog.com/sandwalkers/mainfeatures.gif" type="video/webm"></video><br><br><ul><li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through ever-changing landscapes.</li><li>Fight and survive in the face of acid rain, sandstorms and heat waves.</li><li>Tame hostile creatures, rescue refugees, seek allies for mutual aid, or follow the blood path and loot everything you can.</li><li>Seek rich arable soil to plant a new Tree City for your people.</li><li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li><li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li></ul><br><br><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" data-fallbackurl="https://items.gog.com/sandwalkers/Gif_Additionalfeatures.gif"><source src="https://items.gog.com/sandwalkers/additionalfeatures.webm"></video><br><br><ul><li>Make choices that will affect your future expeditions.</li><li>Each character has a different job that greatly influences the gameplay.
